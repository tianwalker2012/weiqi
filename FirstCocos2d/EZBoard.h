//What's the purpose of this class?
//Why I create a layer for the board?
//When user touch this board, the lay button logic check will get invoked.
//1. Whether we lay white button or black button?
//2. Where to put that button?
//3. What will happen after that button have laid?
//This is like a UI for all the lay button funtionality.
//For current stage, I will put all the logic here, later I will refactor them 
//Out to place suitable for them.
